## Running This Demo

This demo only requires running the `swim.liquid.LiquidPlane` class.

Thus, `gradle static-traits:run` is sufficient for those who pick Option 2 in [`README.md` from the parent directory](../README.md).

For those who pick Option 3, simply execute `gradle static-traits:build`, unpackage either artifact in `static-traits/build/distributions`, and run the appropriate script in `bin/`; no file copying/editing is required.
