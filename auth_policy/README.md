# Auth Policy

Code corresponding to the [Auth Policy cookbook](https://swimos.org/tutorials/auth-policy/).

## Running This Demo

This demo requires running the `swim.basic.BasicPlane` class and the `swim.basic.CustomClient` class in that order. Review [`README.md` from the parent directory](../README.md) for instructions on how to do this. For those who pick Option 2, the `gradle` task corresponding to `swim.basic.CustomClient` is called `runClient`.
