Code corresponding to the [Forms cookbook](https://swimos.org/tutorials/forms/).

## Forms Motivation

A Form defines a conversion between a structural type, and some POJO. The mold method converts a Java object to an Item.
And the cast method converts an Item to a Java object, if possible.

## Running This Demo

This demo requires running the `swim.basic.BasicPlane` class and the `swim.basic.CustomClient` class in that order.
Review [`README.md` from the parent directory](../README.md) for instructions on how to do this. For those who pick
Option 2, the `gradle` task corresponding to `swim.basic.CustomClient` is called `runClient`.
