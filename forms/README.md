# Forms

Code corresponding to the [Forms cookbook](https://swim.dev/tutorials/forms/).

*Read this in other languages: [简体中文](README.zh-cn.md)*

## Forms Motivation
A Form defines a conversion between a structural type, and some POJO. The mold method converts a Java object to an Item. And the cast method converts an Item to a Java object, if possible.

## Running This Demo

This demo requires running the `swim.basic.BasicPlane` class and the `swim.basic.CustomClient` class in that order. Review [`README.md` from the parent directory](../README.md) for instructions on how to do this. For those who pick Option 2, the `gradle` task corresponding to `swim.basic.CustomClient` is called `runClient`.
