# Ingress Bridges

Code corresponding to the [Ingress Bridges cookbook](https://swimos.org/tutorials/http-ingress-bridges/).

## Running This Demo

This demo only requires running the `swim.forex.ForexPlane` class.

Thus, `gradle http-ingress-bridges:run` is sufficient for those who pick Option 2
in [`README.md` from the parent directory](../README.md).

For those who pick Option 3, simply execute `http-ingress-bridges:build`, unpackage either artifact
in `http-ingress-bridges/build/distributions`, and run the appropriate script in `bin/`; no file copying/editing is
required.
