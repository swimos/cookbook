Code corresponding to the [Server Downlinks cookbook](https://swimos.org/tutorials/server-downlinks/).

## Running This Demo

This demo requires running the `swim.basic.BasicPlane` class and the `swim.basic.CustomServer` class in that order. Review [`README.md` from the parent directory](../README.md) for instructions on how to do this. For those who pick Option 2, the `gradle` task corresponding to `swim.basic.CustomPlane` is called `runServer`.
