# Server Downlinks

Code corresponding to the [Server Downlinks cookbook](https://swimos.org/tutorials/server-downlinks/).

## Running This Demo

This demo requires running the `swim.basic.WarehousePlane` class and the `swim.basic.SupplierPlane` class in that order.
Review [`README.md` from the parent directory](../README.md) for instructions on how to do this. For those who pick
Option 2, the `gradle` task corresponding to `swim.basic.SupplierPlane` is called `runServer`.
