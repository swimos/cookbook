# HTTP Ingestion

Code corresponding to the [HTTP Ingestion Guide](/FIXME).

## Running This Demo

This demo only requires running the `swim.forex.ForexPlane` class.

Thus, `gradle http-ingress-bridges:run` is sufficient for those who pick Option 2 in [`README.md` from the parent directory](../README.md).

For those who pick Option 3, simply execute `http-ingress-bridges:build`, unpackage either artifact in `http-ingress-bridges/build/distributions`, and run the appropriate script in `bin/`; no file copying/editing is required.
