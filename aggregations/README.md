# Aggregations

Code corresponding to the [Aggregations Guide](https://www.swimos.org/guides/aggregations.html).

## Running This Demo

_All commands should be executed from the parent directory._

This demo only requires running the `swim.aggregations.BasicPlane` class.

Thus, `gradle aggregations:run` is sufficient for those who pick Option 2 in [`README.md` from the parent directory](../README.md).

For those who pick Option 3, simply execute `gradle aggregations:build`, unpackage either artifact in `aggregations/build/distributions`, and run the appropriate script in `bin/`; no file copying/editing is required.
